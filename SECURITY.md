## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability in this playbook or related code examples, please report it responsibly.

### Reporting Process

1. **DO NOT** open a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities
2. Email security reports to: **security@example.com** (replace with actual contact)
3. Include the following information:
   - Description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Potential impact
   - Suggested fix (if any)

### Response Timeline

- **Initial Response**: Within 48 hours
- **Status Update**: Within 7 days
- **Resolution Target**: Within 30 days (depending on severity)

### What to Expect

1. **Acknowledgment**: We'll confirm receipt of your report
2. **Investigation**: We'll investigate and validate the issue
3. **Fix**: We'll develop and test a fix
4. **Disclosure**: We'll coordinate disclosure timing with you
5. **Credit**: We'll credit you in the security advisory (if desired)

## Security Considerations for Implementations

### Secrets Management

**DO:**

- Use AWS Secrets Manager or HashiCorp Vault
- Rotate credentials regularly
- Use IAM roles instead of access keys
- Enable MFA for privileged accounts

**DON'T:**

- Commit secrets to version control
- Hardcode credentials in code
- Share credentials via email/chat
- Use root AWS account for operations

### Access Controls

**DO:**

- Implement least privilege principle
- Use role-based access control (RBAC)
- Enable audit logging
- Review access regularly

**DON'T:**

- Grant admin access by default
- Share credentials between team members
- Skip access review processes

### Data Protection

**DO:**

- Encrypt data at rest (S3, DynamoDB, etc.)
- Encrypt data in transit (TLS 1.2+)
- Enable versioning for critical data
- Implement backup and recovery procedures

**DON'T:**

- Store sensitive data unencrypted
- Expose internal endpoints publicly
- Skip encryption for "internal only" data

### Infrastructure Security

**DO:**

- Use VPC isolation
- Enable AWS CloudTrail
- Implement WAF rules
- Regular security scanning
- Keep dependencies updated

**DON'T:**

- Allow 0.0.0.0/0 ingress unnecessarily
- Disable security features "temporarily"
- Ignore security warnings

## Security Testing

### Chaos Engineering Safety

When running chaos tests:

1. **Test in non-production first**
2. **Limit blast radius** (max 5% of traffic)
3. **Get approval** from stakeholders
4. **Have rollback plan** ready
5. **Monitor continuously** during tests
6. **Emergency kill-switch** available

### Security Checklist for Contributions

Before submitting code:

- [ ] No hardcoded credentials
- [ ] No sensitive data in logs
- [ ] Input validation implemented
- [ ] Error messages don't leak information
- [ ] Dependencies are up to date
- [ ] Security scanning passed
- [ ] Access controls reviewed

## Responsible Disclosure

We follow responsible disclosure practices:

1. **Private disclosure** to us first
2. **Coordinated fix** development
3. **Public disclosure** after fix is deployed
4. **CVE assignment** if applicable
5. **Security advisory** publication

### Hall of Fame

We recognize security researchers who responsibly disclose vulnerabilities:
