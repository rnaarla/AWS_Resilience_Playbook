# Observability Framework

The observability layer uses a **Causal Event Graph (CEG)** approach.

### Core Components
- **Causal Graph Engine (RGE):** Real-time correlation of cross-service telemetry.
- **Anomaly Detector:** ML-based pattern recognition for automation drift.
- **Metric Federation Layer:** Aggregates MTTD, MTTR, CFI, and ADI into unified dashboards.
