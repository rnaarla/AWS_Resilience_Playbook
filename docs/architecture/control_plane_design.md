# Control Plane Design

This document defines the reference architecture for autonomous, fault-tolerant control planes.

## Key Components
- **Immutable Config Store:** Stores signed and versioned configuration manifests.
- **Causal Validation Layer:** Enforces correct temporal sequencing before commits.
- **Quorum Enforcer:** Ensures 3-AZ consensus before applying Route53 or DNS changes.
- **Self-Reasoning Engine (SRE-AI):** AI-based validator that detects cyclic dependencies.
- **Human Override Layer (HOP):** Emergency intervention mechanism for live systems.
