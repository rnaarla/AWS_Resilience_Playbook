# 🏗️ Resilience Playbook
### Operational Guidelines and Design Patterns for Autonomous Cloud Systems

This repository defines a next-generation framework for **autonomous infrastructure reliability**, transforming lessons from the 2025 DynamoDB outage into a blueprint for **unbreakable distributed systems**. It integrates AWS, Google SRE, Meta, and NVIDIA principles into a unified **Resilience Operating Framework (ROF)**.

---

## 📘 Overview

The playbook defines the architectural, operational, and governance disciplines required to ensure **no recursive automation failure can ever occur again** in large-scale distributed systems.

---

## 🧠 Core Tenets

- **Bounded Autonomy:** All automation operates within well-defined decision boundaries.
- **Immutability:** Every configuration is versioned, signed, and reversible.
- **Causal Awareness:** Automation must validate causality before applying state.
- **Human Override Protocol (HOP):** Immediate human intervention without downtime.
- **Telemetry-First Design:** Observability and causal graphs embedded natively.
- **Fault Domain Containment:** Multi-layer partitioning across AZ, region, and service.

## 📊 Metrics

| Metric | Description | Target |
|---------|-------------|--------|
| **MTTD** | Mean Time to Detect | ≤ 60 seconds |
| **MTTR** | Mean Time to Recover | ≤ 30 minutes |
| **CFI** | Change Failure Index | ≤ 0.01 |
| **BRI** | Blast Radius Index | ≤ 1 dependent service |
| **ADI** | Automation Drift Index | ≤ 0.1 delta |
| **CIS** | Causal Integrity Score | ≥ 0.95 |

## 🔁 Turnaround Playbook

1. **Freeze Automation** (Read-only state across Enactors)
2. **Causal Graph Analysis** (Detect correlation loops)
3. **Shadow Plane Promotion** (Activate regional backup control)
4. **Human Verification** (Validate AI RCA recommendations)
5. **Controlled Recovery** (Reapply last valid configuration)
6. **Audit and Drift Verification**
7. **Postmortem and Knowledge Propagation**

---

## 🧩 Governance

- **Resilience Review Board (RRB):** Cross-service oversight for control plane safety.
- **Change Failure Index (CFI):** Quantitative indicator of automation reliability.
- **Safety Integrity Level (SIL):** Peer-reviewed control levels for shared automation.
- **Resilience Maturity Index (RMI):** Continuous maturity scoring model.

---

## 🧪 Testing Frameworks

- **Chaos Injection:** Weekly race condition and delay simulation.
- **Digital Twin Simulation:** Sandbox replay of automation before live rollout.
- **Cross-Plane Fault Drills:** Bi-weekly combined control plane recovery tests.

---

## 🧭 Goal

By FY2028, all Tier-1 AWS-style control planes achieve **Level 5 Maturity — Self-Evolving Systems**, capable of:
- Predicting failure before occurrence.
- Automatically quarantining faulty agents.
- Explaining corrective actions with full auditability.
